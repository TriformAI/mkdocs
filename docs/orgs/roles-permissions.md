# Roles & Permissions

Each user in an Organization has one of three roles.

| Role   | Permissions |
|-------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full access, including billing, GitHub linking, and user removal. |
| **Admin** | Manage Nodes, Projects, and users (except removing Owners). |
| **Member** | Create/edit/run Nodes; cannot manage users or billing. |

## Guidance
- Keep the number of **Owners** small.
- Promote trusted Members to **Admin** for day-to-day management.
- Review roles quarterly.

!!! tip "Principle of least privilege"
    Grant only the access required to perform the job effectively.
