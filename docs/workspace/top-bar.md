# Top Bar

The Top Bar helps you navigate context quickly and manage deployments.

## Breadcrumbs
- Always shows your current context (e.g., **Org / Project / Flow**).
- **Click any crumb** to jump directly to that level.

## Home
- Click the Triform logo to go to the **Projects** dashboard.

## Profile Menu
- **Organization** — switch active Org or open Organizations overview.
- **Account** — account overview (coming soon).
- **Log out** — end session and clear tokens.

## Deploy button
- Appears when local changes are **ahead** of the last deployed state.
- Click to deploy the **latest** changes for your current Project.

!!! tip "When in doubt, use breadcrumbs"
    Breadcrumbs are the fastest way to move between Project view, Flow view, and back to the Org without losing your place.
