# First Launch & Layout Overview

When you sign in, you land in your **first Project** with the **Canvas** open.

## The workspace at a glance
- **Top Bar** — breadcrumbs, home, profile, deploy.
- **Canvas** — where you build and debug visually.
- **Chat Panel (Triton)** — conversational control and status.
- **Properties Panel** — configuration, inputs, execution.

## Your first choices
- **Create a Project** or **Create an Agent** on the Canvas.
- Or open existing **Flows/Actions/Agents** to explore structure.

## Orientation tips
- **Click** to select a Node.
- **Double-click** any Node to open it (Project/Agent/Flow).
- **Right-click** for context menus (on Canvas or Node).

## What’s next
- Learn the **Top Bar** for navigation and deploys.
- Master the **Canvas** to construct systems.
- Use the **Properties Panel** to execute with payloads.
- Ask **Triton** to automate routine setup.

!!! tip "A simple first build"
    Create a Flow with: *Input → Action (returns a message) → Output*. Execute it with a small JSON payload to verify your end-to-end loop.
