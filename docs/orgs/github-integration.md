# GitHub Integration

Link a GitHub account to enable publishing components from within Triform.

## What linking enables
- Publish selected components (e.g., Actions/Flows) to GitHub.
- Keep an external, versioned record of important artifacts.

## Setup
1. From Organization settings, choose **Link GitHub**.
2. Approve OAuth for the Org-level GitHub account.
3. Select repositories to grant access.

## Practices
- Use a **service account** or Org app for stability.
- Keep READMEs and examples up-to-date for consumers.
- Review repository permissions regularly.

!!! note "Future expansion"
    As capabilities expand, you may publish versioned Flows or full component bundles to GitHub or other targets.
