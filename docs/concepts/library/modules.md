# Modules

Modules are importable utilities (Python) that Actions can reuse.

## Use cases
- Common helpers (validation, formatting)
- Lightweight adapters (API clients, data loaders)
- Constants and enums shared across Actions

## Guidelines
- Keep Modules **pure-Python** and dependency-light.
- Document public functions; avoid tight coupling to specific Actions.
- Version functions cautiously to preserve compatibility.

!!! tip "Refactor to Modules"
    If you copy a helper between Actions twice, itâ€™s time to promote it into a Module.
