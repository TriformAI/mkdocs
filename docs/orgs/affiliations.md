# Affiliations

Affiliations define a userâ€™s membership in Organizations and Projects.

## Scope
- **Organization affiliation** grants access to Projects and components within the Org.
- Users can hold different **roles** per Org.

## Typical patterns
- One personal Org (Owner) + one or more team Orgs (Member/Admin).
- Contractors invited as **Members** with limited permissions.

!!! note "Granularity"
    Roles apply at the Organization level; Projects inherit Org-level access policies.
