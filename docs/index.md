# Welcome to Triform

Triform is a visual platform for building, running, and monitoring AI-powered systems. Instead of stitching together code and configs, you **compose logic on a Canvas** as Nodes (Agents, Flows, Actions) and connect them with Edges.

## Who this guide is for
- Engineers building end-to-end AI workflows
- Product teams iterating quickly on prototypes
- Non-technical collaborators reviewing and testing behavior

## What you can build
- Tool-using **Agents** that call Actions/Flows
- **Flows** that orchestrate multi-step logic
- **Actions** that run precise pieces of Python
- APIs or scheduled jobs that expose top-level components

## How Triform is organized
- **Organizations** → top-level ownership & access
- **Projects** → focused workspaces inside an Organization
- **Library** → reusable building blocks (Actions, Flows, etc.)
- **Canvas** → the visual surface where you design and debug

## Five-minute Quickstart
1. **Sign in** at `app.triform.ai` with Discord or GitHub.
2. You land in your first **Project** with the **Canvas** open.
3. **Create** a Flow or Agent from the Canvas.
4. **Connect** Nodes with Edges to shape behavior.
5. **Execute** it from the **Properties → Execute** panel.

!!! tip "Fastest first success"
    Start with a Flow: *Input → Action → Output*. Use the Execute panel to run a small JSON payload.

## Need help?
- Use the **Chat Panel (Triton)** to create, connect, or run components conversationally.
- Invite teammates from **Profile → Organization → View**.
- Share feedback any time—your input shapes our roadmap.
