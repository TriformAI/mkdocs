# Properties Panel: Overview

The Properties Panel adapts to your selection and is where you **configure** and **run** components.

## Sections
- **Global** — Organization/Project-level settings available to all components in the Project (e.g., Variables).
- **Components** — Definition/Information and Content for the selected Node.
- **Execute** — Run the selected Node with a JSON payload.
- **Input & Output** — Define inputs/outputs, types, defaults, and parallel execution behavior.

!!! note "Context aware"
    The Properties Panel shows only the sections relevant to your current selection (Project, Flow, Agent, or Action).
