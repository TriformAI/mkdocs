# Login & Registration

You sign in to Triform using OAuth with **Discord** or **GitHub**.

## Sign in
1. Go to **app.triform.ai**.
2. Choose **Discord** or **GitHub**.
3. Approve OAuth and you’ll be redirected to your Canvas.

## First-time registration
- A **personal Organization** is created automatically.
- A **default Project** is provisioned and opened.

## Re-authentication & logout
- If your session expires or OAuth access is revoked, you’ll be prompted to sign in again.
- **Logout** terminates active tokens and clears your browser session.

## Permissions & identity
- Your **display name** comes from the provider (editable later).
- **Email** is used for invitations and notifications.
- You may connect **GitHub** to publish components (when enabled).

!!! note "Multiple Organizations"
    You can belong to multiple Organizations. Switch via **Profile → Organization**.

## Troubleshooting
- **Popup blocked**: allow popups for `app.triform.ai`.
- **Wrong account**: sign out of the provider, then sign in with the intended account.
- **Stuck redirect**: clear cookies for `app.triform.ai` or try a private window.
- **2FA issues**: resolve with the provider, then repeat OAuth.

If problems persist, contact your Org Owner or reach us via the community channel.
