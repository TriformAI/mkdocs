# Library (Overview)

The Library is your Organization’s shared catalog of building blocks.

## What lives in the Library
- **Actions, Flows, Agents**
- **Triggers** (entry points like APIs/Schedules)
- **Modules** (importable utility code)
- **Variables** (shared configuration values)
- **Payloads** (saved examples)

## Why a unified Library
- **Discoverability** — Find and reuse components.
- **Consistency** — Share patterns across Projects.
- **Composability** — Build bigger systems from proven parts.

## Versioning & reuse
- Treat Library items as **reusable artifacts**.
- Prefer small, well-documented pieces with clear contracts.

!!! note "Project vs. Library"
    Project-scoped Variables live under **Properties → Global Variables**. Library Variables are organizational and reused across Projects.
