# Community Library — Upcoming

A curated, open library of high-quality components built by the community.

## Goals
- Provide **ready-to-use** Actions and Flows for common tasks.
- Showcase **exemplars** with transparent performance metrics.
- Encourage **reuse** and consistent patterns.

## Submission guidelines (draft)
- Clear **README** with intent, I/O, and examples.
- Minimal, pure-Python dependencies.
- Payloads for **minimal**, **typical**, and **edge** cases.
- License compatibility and attribution.

## Review & quality bar
- Automated checks (lint, size, dependency hygiene).
- Human review for clarity and correctness.
- Versioning and changelog requirements.

## Roadmap
- Launch starter set (text preprocessing, validation, routing).
- Add rating and usage signals.
- Introduce “trusted” badges for vetted components.

!!! tip "Design to be remixed"
    Keep components small, well-named, and composable so others can slot them into their Flows with minimal changes.
