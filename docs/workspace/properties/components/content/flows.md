# Properties → Components → Content → Flows

Flows contain components executed in a defined order or pattern.

## Configure behavior
- Arrange sub-components (Actions/Agents/Flows) on the Canvas.
- Use **Input/Output** ports to define data entering and leaving the Flow.
- Optionally design **parallel** paths (see Input & Output → Parallel).

## When to use a Flow
- Multistep transformations
- Branching logic
- Orchestration of tool calls

!!! note "Composability"
    A Flow can be used as a Node inside another Flow or as a tool for an Agent.
