# Flow View: Node Interactions

Use simple gestures to keep Flows readable and manageable.

## Move & arrange
- Drag Nodes to align and reduce crossing Edges.

## Inspect
- Click a Node to view its configuration in **Properties**.

## Open
- Double-click to open an Action, Agent, or sub-Flow.

## Context menu
- Right-click a Node for context-specific actions (options vary by Node type).

!!! tip "Declutter early"
    As a Flow grows, periodically rearrange Nodes to preserve left-to-right data flow and reduce cognitive load.
