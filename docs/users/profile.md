# User Profile

Your profile represents your identity in Triform.

## Fields
- **Name** — Display name (sourced from provider or editable).
- **Auth Provider IDs** — Discord/GitHub identifiers used for OAuth.
- **Email** — For notifications and invitations.
- **Affiliations** — Organizations and roles.

## Good practices
- Keep your **email** current for invites and alerts.
- Use a consistent display name across Orgs to ease discovery.

!!! note "Multiple providers"
    You may authenticate with Discord or GitHub; link GitHub if you plan to publish components.
