# Canvas: Project View

Project View lists the **top-level components** (Agents or Flows) for the Project.

## Key points
- Items are **not connected** here; itâ€™s an overview/list.
- Only **top-level Agents/Flows** can be **exposed** via API or Schedule.
- Top-level components can **contain** other components.

## Common actions
- **Open** a top-level Agent/Flow to work inside it.
- **Create** a new Agent or Flow from the Canvas.
- **Rename** and organize to reflect your domain.

!!! tip "Design for exposure"
    If you plan to expose something as an API or Schedule, keep it **top-level** and give it a stable name early.
